# This is a test
## We will see if this goes better than last time
### Last time I got stuck on the 'add an image' part of the tutorial and it would not recognize it as complete. 

This is a description of what I have changed. I added three headers in descending sizes and explained why I am trying this again from the beginning. 

Just adding the exact image from the tutorial this time. Last time I tried to use another image I found online and it did not work.

``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
